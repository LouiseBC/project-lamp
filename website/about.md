We're two alumni of [Recurse NYC](https://www.recurse.com/), Spring 1, 2017 batch.

This is **Пroject λamp**, an interactive website that allows the user to learn functional programming fundamentals and concepts through programming exercises, à la [*Eloquent JavaScript*](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

If you feel like suggesting changes, a new chapter or anything of the sort, please open an issue on [the project page](http://github.com/lazywithclass/project-lamp). Any help is more than welcome!
