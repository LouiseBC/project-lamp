          <h3 id="1-functional-programming">1. Functional Programming?</h3>
          <p>Functional Programming (FP) can be thought of simply as a method of writing computer programs where <em>specification</em> takes precedence over direct manipulation of computer memory and executable <em>instructions</em>. This is a bit of an oversimplification, as FP offers quite a bit more benefits that simply allowing a programmer to program <em>differently</em>.</p>

          <p>Nonetheless, the latter of these is (probably) the more familiar concept of what computer programming is, as it is the primary idealogy behind languages like C, Java and Python. In these languages, programmers compose instructions for computers to execute and allow for the free manipulation (i.e., reading and writing) of values stored within memory. For example, let’s take the following code snippet written in Python:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lazywithclass/26426f3b0f52ed75765fe32ee2f45498.js"></script>

          <p>To those familiar with programming in <em>imperative</em> languages (like Python), we know that the above code executes from top to bottom, line by line. Given this, we can reason that the following occurs when the code is executed by a computer:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The value <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> is stored inside a variable named <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>.</li>
            <li>The variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is read from memory, the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> is added to it  and is stored in the new variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> (<em>Note</em>: the value stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is unchanged).</li>
            <li>Both variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> are read from memory and stored inside a tuple, resulting in the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">(3, 5)</code> being printed onto the console.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>With this, we can say that the code snippet <em>reflects</em> how a computer would peform the above computation until it ultimately produces its final value and exits. While in certain situations, a programmer might find this method of programming useful (indeed, <em>necessary</em> at times), programming in such a way is not always desirable or necessary.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, while functional languages don’t (quite) offer the seamless access to computer memory and don’t (necessarily) feature an inherit structure in the order in which code is executed (we’ll get back to this point later), functional languages offer something unique and powerful that imperative languages do not. To prove our point, let’s take the standard, poster-child example of functional programming: <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicksort</code>. Let’s first recall how <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicksort</code> is implemented by writing some pseudocode:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose a <code class="highlighter-rouge">pivot</code> element inside the given array/list</li>
            <li>Split the array into two new arrays, one containing elements less than <code class="highlighter-rouge">pivot</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls1</code>) and the other containing elements greater (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls2</code>), arbitrarily breaking ties.</li>
            <li>Recur on both of the new lists to sort them.</li>
            <li>Place the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pivot</code> element in between the newly sorted lists (e.g. result = <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls1</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">pivot</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls2</code>).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The above pseudocode, more or less, reflects how to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicksort</code> in an imperative language. To do this, the programmer would need to design the individual <em>steps</em> in such a way that the computer executing the code peforms each of the above points in the correct manner. Now, let’s see how to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicksort</code> in Haskell, a purely, functional programming language:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lazywithclass/d01cef0ab300e6fcb294e7f19527d5c6.js"></script>

          <p>Yes. 5 lines, and, with some inlining, we can compress the above definition down into 3 lines. Writing short code, however, is <em>not</em> the only reason to write in a language like Haskell. If we take the time to study the code above, we can see that it’s <em>not</em> designed as a step-by-step instruction of what a computer should do to peform the intended computation but more as a <em>specification</em> of what the computation itself is supposed to do. In this, as programmers of functional language, we do not need to worry about what the computer actually needs to do but only on designing the proper logic around our given program so that it peforms as intended. Thus, at the cost of some performance (i.e., imperative code <em>generally</em> performs slightly better than functional code), we alleviate the need to design all the intermediary steps of a computation and instead are allowed to work at a <em>higher-level</em> of designing computer programs.</p>

          <p>We won’t go into much more detail about the diffferences of imperative and functional code (this is, in fact, only the <em>intro</em> chapter). For now, it is important to clearly state that there are benefits and pitfalls in designing computer programs in both manners of writing code.</p>

          <h3 id="2-what-were-doing-here">2. What We’re Doing Here</h3>
          <p>This is <strong>Пroject λamp</strong> (PL), a simple, down to earth introduction to the vast and ever-expanding world of functional programming. This project can be thought of as a tutorial into the core concepts of languages that feature some functional programming ideals and as well as those that rely heavily on them.</p>

          <p>For this book, we are using the <em>PureScript</em> programming language, a flavor of Haskell. Unlike Haskell, PureScript is intended for use as a <em>JavaScript replacement</em>, giving us the needed flexibility for developing a browser-based teaching tool that not only <em>teaches</em> functional programming but also allows users to interact with working code within their browser. This takes direct inspiration from <em><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a></em>, which provides much of the same utility for learning the JavaScript programming language.</p>

          <p>We must clarify that this book is <strong>not</strong> a book that teaches PureScript (one can find that <a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read">here</a>). Our goal is to provide a seamless and hands-on experience of learning functional languages (like Haskell and PureScript), because we believe that this manner of learning is something of great value, especially when it comes to learning functional programming and its core concepts and ideals.</p>

          <h3 id="3-how-to-use-this-book">3. How to Use this Book</h3>
          <p>Throughout this book, one will find <em>many</em> code examples, most of which are written in PureScript (sometimes made to look like Haskell) and all of which are user-interactable. That is, if one should desire to mess around with the given examples, one is free (in fact, <em>encouraged</em>) to do so!</p>

          <p>It should be mentioned, however, that, unlike a language like JavaScript, a purely functional language does not have easy access to <em>effectful computations</em>, the simplest example of which is <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code>. To those more familiar with languages that allow the free-reign usage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> functions, this might take some getting used to. One should not be too wary, as functional languages offer something that is also quite useful, some would argue <em>more</em> so than being able to interact seamlessly with the console, which brings us to our next point.</p>

          <p>In this book, we let <strong>exercises</strong> do the talking, a liberty that is present due in part to an advantage of certain functional languages. We hope that the reader will soon come to understand what we mean by this.</p>

          <h3 id="exercises">Exercises:</h3>
          <div class="js-editor" data-identifier="quicksort" style="width: auto; height:150px;">-- 1. Take a look at the definition of quicksort
quicksort :: forall a. (Ord a) => List a -> List a
quicksort Nil    = Nil
quicksort (x:xs) = xsLess <> (singleton x) <> xsMore
    where xsLess = quicksort (filter (\a -> a <= x) xs)
          xsMore = quicksort (filter (\a -> a > x) xs)</div>
          <input class="js-console"></input><button class="js-go">REPL</button>
          <p class="js-errors quicksort"></p>
          <p>Your answer: <code class="js-results quicksort"></code><code class="blinking-cursor">|</code></p>

          <p>What do you suppose the first line of the code (the <em>type declaration</em>) says about this function? What kinds of <code class="highlighter-rouge">lists</code> does this function work with? It might come as a surprise to hear, but one should not have to worry about understanding the code to answer this question.</p>

          <div class="js-editor" data-identifier="type-declaration" style="width: auto; height:120px;">-- 2. Write the type declaration for the following:
id x = x

const x y = x</div>
          <p class="js-errors type-declaration"></p>

          <p><strong>HINT</strong>: Look back at exercise 1. What does the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> mean inside of the type declaration for <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicksort</code>?</p>
